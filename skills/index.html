            "Adrian was an amazing part of the PWA Studio product at
            Magento/Adobe starting in 2018. As one of the early developers, he
            helped shape key PWA experiences around search, navigation and other
            areas that were important for the project and team â€“ all part of the
            next-generation PWA storefront experience of Magento. His attention
            to detail from both a design and technical perspective was widely
            known and respected as one of the top contributors. Beyond his work,
            he was always open to feedback and his positive attitude helped
            bring other contributors in the process. There will always be a
            place for him in the Magento/Adobe community."

            connecting with his clients whilst maintaining professionality at
            all times. Although Adrian worked intermittently on our Zee & Co
