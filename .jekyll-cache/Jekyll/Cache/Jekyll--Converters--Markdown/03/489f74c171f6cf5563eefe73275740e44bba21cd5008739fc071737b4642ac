<p>Gatsby is a popular static site generator, based on React. It is a very flexible framework due to the extension options using plugins. While researching Gatsby and taking notes of must-have plugins, I've noticed that all font loading plugins are either deprecated or not maintained anymore.</p>

<p>After noticing the gap in the market, I've decided to develop the plugin myself using modern async font loading and FOUT handling methods.</p>

<p>I've used <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Roberts' fast font loading</a> method to load fonts asynchronously, and I've came up with the really simple and effective method to detect when font has finished loading using Web Font API. With these two combined, fonts can be loaded after the website has finished loading and the change between the fallback font and main font will be barely noticeable.</p>

<p>I've also wrote an<a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-to-load-fonts-in-a-way-that-fights-fout-and-makes-lighthouse-happy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article for CSS-Tricks</a> where I've explained in detail what is going on under the hood.</p>
