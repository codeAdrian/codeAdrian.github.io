"Adrian was an <strong>amazing part</strong> of the PWA Studio product at Magento/Adobe starting in 2018. As one of the early developers, he <strong>helped shape key PWA experiences</strong> around search, navigation and other areas that were important for the project and team (...) His attention to detail from both a design and technical perspective was <strong>widely known and respected as one of the top contributors</strong>. Beyond his work, he was always open to feedback and his <strong>positive attitude</strong> helped bring other contributors in the process. There will always be a place for him in the Magento/Adobe community."
