description: "I thrive on putting my skills to the test, which is why I've participated in several hackathons. I've had the honor of winning grand prizes in three major competitions: the Twilio Hackathon 2019, the Egghead VSCode Hackathon 2020, and the Hashnode Xmas Hackathon 2020. Check out my projects to learn more about the stories behind these achievements."
