description: This is an award-winning project created for Hashnode Christmas hackathon 2020. It was made in just a few days using React and Canvas API. This hackathon was an opportunity for me to play around with new browser features, so I decided to go with the Canvas API and create an awesome painting app with a stunning rainbow brush.

I remember when I was buying paint sets for school, I was impressed by the images on the boxes. They showed a beautiful painting and were basically communicating "You can paint this beautiful image with this set". So I wanted to mimic that feeling with the splash screen.

There are two tools that set apart this paint app from the others. First tool is a "Magic Brush" which paints a beautiful stream of every available color (with a fixed saturation and lightness) in a gradient. This allows users to create colorful brush strokes.

The second tool is the "Dynamic Width" tool which changes the paint tool brush radius from a minimum to a maximum value pixel by pixel, creating a beautiful flow of paint. When combined with the Magic Brush tool, it yields some astonishing results.

Other tools include:

* Brush preview (color and size)
* Standard solid color brush
* Eraser
* Color picker
* Image downloader (download images as png)
* Manual brush size control
* Magic brush color saturation and lightness controls

My project was one of the 5 grand prize winner projects, picked out from 100 awesome project submissions. I was awarded an Amazon giftcard in $500 dollar value, which is great considering I've worked on it just a few days.
