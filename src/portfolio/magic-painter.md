description: This is an award-winning project created for the Hashnode Christmas hackathon 2020. It was made in just a few days using React and the Canvas API. This hackathon was an opportunity for me to play around with new browser features, so I decided to go with the Canvas API and create an awesome painting app with a stunning rainbow brush.

I remember when I was buying paint sets for school, I was always impressed by the images on the boxes. They displayed beautiful paintings and basically communicated, "You can create this beautiful image with this set." I wanted to capture that same feeling with the splash screen for the app.

There are two key tools that set this paint app apart from others. The first is the "Magic Brush," which paints a beautiful stream of every available color in a gradient, with fixed saturation and lightness. This allows users to create vibrant, colorful brush strokes.

The second is the "Dynamic Width" tool, which adjusts the brush radius from a minimum to a maximum value pixel by pixel, creating a stunning flow of paint. When combined with the Magic Brush tool, it produces some truly remarkable results.

Other tools in the app include:

- Brush preview (color and size)
- Standard solid color brush
- Eraser
- Color picker
- Image downloader (download images as PNG)
- Manual brush size control
- Magic brush color saturation and lightness controls

My project was one of the 5 grand prize-winning projects, selected from 100 amazing submissions. I was awarded a $500 Amazon gift card, which was a great reward considering I worked on it for just a few days.
