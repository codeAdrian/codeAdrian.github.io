I love exploring new design and front-end concepts, and I’m particularly drawn to vibrant, charming design styles. I find them refreshing, especially compared to the more mundane designs I work with professionally on a daily basis. This particular style even reminds me of one of my favorite childhood cartoon series — Wallace and Gromit by Aardman.

I developed this package while working on the [Claymorphism article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/03/claymorphism-css-ui-design-trend/) for Smashing Magazine. After the article was published, it sparked a major discussion on the web, particularly on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30852884), where there were varied opinions on the subject.

I also created a [demo website](https://codeadrian.github.io/clay.css/) that showcases all the features of the clay.css.

The article and clay.css have gained significant traction on Twitter, reaching developer communities worldwide, with many praising the unique style and feel. It was even featured in the [CSS-Tricks newsletter](https://css-tricks.com/newsletter/288-dappled-light-with-css-and-fluid-typography/), which I'm incredibly proud of.

I love this effect I’ve seen in 3D art circles but I didn’t know it was called claymorphism. Well, here’s a handy micro CSS utility class called clay.css that immediately turns your regular ol’ box components into something with a bit more depth and oomph like this.
