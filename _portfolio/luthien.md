<p>This website consists of Homepage, Category page, and cart/checkout page. On category page, user can add product to the cart, search through the catalog and switch between the list/grid view. Checkout has been simplified with hard-coded data so there is no need to fill out the forms.</p>

<p>Of course, my recent work with PWA studio is more feature-complete and overall better, but I consider this to be impressive proof-of-concept at the time.</p>
