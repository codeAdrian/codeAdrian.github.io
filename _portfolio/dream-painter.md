This hackathon was an opportunity for me to play around with new tech and APIs, so I decided to go with the Canvas API and create an awesome painting app.

<p>This is an <strong>award-winning project</strong> created for Hashnode Christmas hackathon 2020. It was coded in just a few days using React, Typescript, React custom hooks and Canvas API. This hackathon was an opportunity for me to play around with new tech and APIs, so I decided to go with the Canvas API and create an awesome painting app.</p>

<h2 class="title--secondary project__heading">Splash screen</h2>
</div>
<p>I remember when I was buying paint sets for school, I was impressed by the images on the boxes. They showed a beautiful painting and were basically communicating "You can paint this beautiful image with this set". So I wanted to mimic that feeling with the splash screen.</p>

<p>I also wanted to use CSS properties I don't have much chance to use, like conic gradient borders and overlayed gradients on the text. The button also has some nice transition animation. Additionally, the button colors change over time in a smooth animation.</p>

<p>There are two tools that set apart this paint app from the others, it's what you'd call a "magic part". First tool is a "Magic Brush" which paints a beautiful stream of every available color (with a fixed saturation and lightness) in a gradient. This allows users to create magical and dream-like art.</p>

<p>
The second tool is the "Dynamic Width" tool which changes the paint tool brush radius from a minimum to a maximum value pixel by pixel, creating a beautiful flow of paint. When combined with the Magic Brush tool, it yields some astonishing results.

<p>My project was one of the 5 grand prize winner projects, picked out from 100 awesome project submissions. I was awarded an Amazon giftcard in $500 dollar value, which is great considering I've worked on it just a few days.</p>

Hashnode's Christmas Hackathon was one of the most successful developer hackathons during the holidays last month. Over 113 submissions from developers around the world in just 12 days.

To select just 5 winners from 113 was difficult. After a lot of debate internally, our team has decided to choose 5 winners for the Amazon Gift cards ðŸ’³ (worth USD 500) and 10 special mentions.
